#Under Heavy Development

#Manage

##Try out manage:

`chmod u+wx manage`

`./manage -s (or setup)`

`manage -i (or install)`

##Build engine with manage:

`manage engine (or -e)`

##Build game with engine:

`manage game (or -g)` GAMEDIR (the game needs a ./build.sh, just copy it from the snake one and edit it a bit)

##Test engine/game with the newest version

`manage test GAMEDIR`

##Push back to main branch

`manage push (all for everything -or- specifiy file)`

##Find out more:

`manage -h (or help)`

And yes I know it is a little cluttered and keep in mind it has a few errors.

#For Engine Devs:

rebuild engine and game with: `./build.sh`

#For Game Devs:

Tutorials on how to use the engine will be out soon as the engine advances.
