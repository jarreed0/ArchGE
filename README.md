#ArchGE - A 2D Game Engine written in C++ and using SDL2

#test

#DO NOT RUN THE PARK SAMPLE GAME - IT WILL (may) CRASH YOUR COMPUTER HAHA
It doesn't have anything to do with an engine problem, its just the game has an error.

#Under Heavy Development

#Manage

##Try out manage:

`chmod u+wx manage`

`./manage -s (or setup)`

`manage -i (or install)`

##Build engine with manage:

`manage engine (or -e)`

##Build game with engine:

`manage game (or -g)` GAMEDIR (the game needs a ./build.sh, just copy it from the snake one and edit it a bit)

##Test engine/game with the newest version

`manage test GAMEDIR`

##Find out more:

`manage -h (or help)`

And yes I know it is a little cluttered and keep in mind it has a few errors.

#For Engine Devs:

rebuild engine and game with: `./build.sh`

#For Game Devs:

Tutorials on how to use the engine will be out soon as the engine advances.
